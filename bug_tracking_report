1) webpack was running, and then finishing.
solution: looked into the package.json, checked the function calling webpack. The code was incomplete.

2) when in teh browser, if I click a beer I get it on it's own, with more data. If i click again, it shows the next beer..... strange!
-- theory! it's because somewhere I've said 'display beer using index' and elsewhere i've used the id.
FIND IT!
beer model line 55
and then
specificview line 30
I spent about 2 hours trying to find the best solution to this problem. In the end I had to alter the ID of the specific beer upon publishing a single beer:
  bottle.id = bottle.id -1

FULLY CORRECTED IN
Beerdata:

// method to publish data of sepcific thing.
BeerData.prototype.specificBeerDetails = function (index) {
  // console.log("here's the full data", this.data);
  const numero = index -1;
  const specificBeer = this.data[numero];

  // console.log("detail is now", specificBeer);
  //that is an object of the beer
  PubSub.publish('Beer_model:specific-beer-data-ready', specificBeer)
};
